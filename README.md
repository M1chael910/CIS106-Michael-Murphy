# CIS106 Michael Murphy

## Assignment 1

I am taking this course because I enjoy programming a lot. As of now it is the only career I have in mind. I learned programming using Swift when I was in High School, now I am interested in JavaScript and Web Development in general. I am planning to use this course to learn javascript and to review the basics of programming to hopefully get a little better at solving problems. Solving Programming Problems is something I struggle with at time so I'd like to work on that as well as I think this is a good course for that. I look forward to working with you over this year. 

## Assignment 2

I chose JS for this course because of how popular and powerful it is for web development. I plan to use VS Code for most of my development because of how good it is for web development. I used the code editor Atom for a little bit, but I prefer VS-Code overall.

## Assignment 3

This assignment was a really good review of the basics for me, especially when tackling a new programming language. Some of the things I learned about were Data Types, the order of operations, Data type conversions, and the input-process-output-model. I plan to use this to further my knowledge of JavaScript to work on becoming a web developer. 

## Assignment 4

In this assignment I reviewed inputing and outputing data in JavaScript, along with doing simple calculations and printing them out. I plan to use this to improve my Javascript skills and work towards becoming a web developer in the future.
 
## Assignment 5

In this assignment I learned how to use functions in javascript, and how they differ from other languages I have used. I reviewed parameters, arguments, and return statements as well. Also, I learned about breaking down code into seperate functions, and calling them from within the function main. I plan to use these skills to write cleaner code and keep the core features of my code seperated into different functions. I also plan to use these skills to continue working on becoming a web developer. 

## Assignment 6

This assignment reviewed the same topics as the last assignment, and applied it to different exercises. I worked with functions, using parameters to input arguments into the function, and return a value. I used functions to split up the functionallity of my program to keep my code clean and make it easier to debug. I intend to use these skills to improve the quality and readability of my code, and to make it easier to debug, which goes towards my goal of being a web developer. 

## Assignment 7

In this assignment I learned about conditions and the different control structures and how they can be applied to our code. I have a decent understanding of these but it was helpful reviewing them for my specific language this semester. Conditions and control structures are a core part of programming and, in my experience, are used very frequently when coding, which makes them an extremely useful skill to know when becoming a developer. 

## Assignment 8 

This week, we learned about the various kinds of loops, branching statements,how to use the increment and decrement operators to modify the flag to avoid a infinite loop. These skills can be very useful in business to process large amounts of data and repeat actions on that data, and to be able to repeat a line of code multiple times without writing it that many times is very powerful and timesaving.

## Assignment 9

This week we reviewed do loops and how they are used. These loops are very useful for validating input data and asking the user to enter a different value when their value is insufficent. They are also useful for incrementing through large amounts of data and repeating sections of code on each value, which could be very useful in a buissness codebase. I plan to use this skill in working to become a web developer. 

## Assignment 10

This week we focused on for loops. I found it helpful that all arguments in the header of the loop are optional in JavaScript, and made it way easier to understand. These loops are very useful for repeating code until a certain condition is met. They can be used to iterate through data from an array using the first argument in the header to define a variable to serve as a counter. These loops could be useful in a codebase because of their flexability with working with data. I plan to use this skil to work towards becoming a web developer.

## Assignment 11

This week we focused on arrays. Arrays are very powerful and useful for storing and processing data. I learned about the difference between fixed and dynamic arrays, fixed arrays having hardcoded fixed length, and dynamic arrays allow values to be added and removed. We also learned about index notation, searching and sorting through arrays, and how parallel arrays work. These skils are useful because arrays are commennly used in algorithms and business codebases. I plan to use these skills to further my goal of becoming a web developer. 

## Assignment 12

This week we focused on Dynamic arrays. Dynamic arrays are useful because they do not have a fixed capacity, and elements can be added or removed at runtime. This is useful in a business codebase because it allows arrays to be more flexible, and used in more situations. I plan on using these skills to improve my understanding of JavaScript and how to apply it to solving programming problems.   

## Assignment 13 

This week I took a deep dive into strings. I learned about string functions that are built in to various programming languages, and how to use them to modify strings. I also learned about formatting strings, and how JavaScript does not have a dedicated format function like other languages. JavaScript has built in syntax to add values to and format strings.
