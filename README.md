# CIS106 Michael Murphy

## Assignment 1

I am taking this course because I enjoy programming a lot. As of now it is the only career I have in mind. I learned programming using Swift when I was in High School, now I am interested in JavaScript and Web Development in general. I am planning to use this course to learn javascript and to review the basics of programming to hopefully get a little better at solving problems. Solving Programming Problems is something I struggle with at time so I'd like to work on that as well as I think this is a good course for that. I look forward to working with you over this year. 

## Assignment 2

I chose JS for this course because of how popular and powerful it is for web development. I plan to use VS Code for most of my development because of how good it is for web development. I used the code editor Atom for a little bit, but I prefer VS-Code overall.

## Assignment 3

This assignment was a really good review of the basics for me, especially when tackling a new programming language. Some of the things I learned about were Data Types, the order of operations, Data type conversions, and the input-process-output-model. I plan to use this to further my knowledge of JavaScript to work on becoming a web developer. 

## Assignment 4

In this assignment I reviewed inputing and outputing data in JavaScript, along with doing simple calculations and printing them out. I plan to use this to improve my Javascript skills and work towards becoming a web developer in the future.
 
## Assignment 5

In this assignment I learned how to use functions in javascript, and how they differ from other languages I have used. I reviewed parameters, arguments, and return statements as well. Also, I learned about breaking down code into seperate functions, and calling them from within the function main. I plan to use these skills to write cleaner code and keep the core features of my code seperated into different functions. I also plan to use these skills to continue working on becoming a web developer. 

## Assignment 6

This assignment reviewed the same topics as the last assignment, and applied it to different exercises. I worked with functions, using parameters to input arguments into the function, and return a value. I used functions to split up the functionallity of my program to keep my code clean and make it easier to debug. I intend to use these skills to improve the quality and readability of my code, and to make it easier to debug, which goes towards my goal of being a web developer.
