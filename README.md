# CIS106 Michael Murphy

## Assignment 1

I am taking this course because I enjoy programming a lot. As of now it is the only career I have in mind. I learned programming using Swift when I was in High School, now I am interested in JavaScript and Web Development in general. I am planning to use this course to learn javascript and to review the basics of programming to hopefully get a little better at solving problems. Solving Programming Problems is something I struggle with at time so I'd like to work on that as well as I think this is a good course for that. I look forward to working with you over this year.
